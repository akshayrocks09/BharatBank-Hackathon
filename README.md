📡 API Documentation
Not applicable at this stage. The BharatBank prototype uses simulated data for demonstration purposes:

Login OTP verification is mocked (accepts any input).
Dashboard balance (₹25,000) and transactions (e.g., Grocery, Salary) are hardcoded.
Transfer functionality simulates success without a real backend.
➡️ Future iterations will integrate APIs for Aadhaar OTP validation, account data, and transaction processing (e.g., via UPI or bank gateways).
